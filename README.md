#**Overview of the Online Banking System Project**

This Java project is a console-based application designed to simulate basic online banking functionalities. It allows users to manage their bank accounts, perform financial transactions, and update personal information.

##**Key Features**

**Account Management:** Users can create accounts by providing an account number, holder's name, and initial deposit.
Each account is uniquely identified by an account number.

**Deposit and Withdraw Funds:** Users can deposit money into their account.
Withdrawals are allowed up to the available balance, with proper validation to prevent overdrafts.

**Money Transfers:** Users can transfer funds between accounts.
Both the sender's and receiver's accounts are updated with transaction details

**Transaction History:** Each account maintains a log of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
Users can view their accountâ€™s transaction history for a detailed financial overview.

**Personal Information Management:** Users can update their account holder name.

**Console-based Menu:** A user-friendly menu system guides users through the available options.

**Data Storage:** Account details and transactions are stored in memory using a HashMap for efficient retrieval by account number.

###**Core Components**

**BankAccount Class:** Represents an individual bank account.
Stores account details, balance, and transaction history.
Provides methods for deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and updating account holder name.

**OnlineBankingSystem Class:** Contains the main method and drives the application.
Provides a menu-based interface for user interaction.
Manages accounts using a HashMap for quick access.

####**Structure and Workflow**

**Initialization:** The program starts with a menu where users select an operation.

**Operation Execution:** Based on user input, the program performs operations like creating accounts, managing funds, or updating details.
Validations ensure inputs are correct (e.g., positive amounts, sufficient funds, unique account numbers).

**Transaction History Logging:** Every transaction is logged in the transactionHistory list associated with the account.
Users can view all recorded transactions at any time.

**Exit:** Users can exit the system, and all data is lost as it's stored in memory during runtime.

#####**Advantages**

**Encapsulation:** The BankAccount class encapsulates account-specific data and operations.

**Scalability:** The modular design allows easy addition of features like interest calculations or multi-user authentication.

**Efficiency:** Using HashMap for account management ensures quick access to account data.

######**Limitations**

**No Persistent Storage:** Account data is stored in memory and lost when the program exits.
Can be extended with file handling or database integration.

**Single User at a Time:** The system is designed for one user interaction at a time.
Multi-threading can enable concurrent users.

**Basic Input Validation:** Validation is limited to basic checks (e.g., non-negative deposits).
Could be extended for robust error handling.

#######**Possible Enhancements**

**Persistent Storage:** Save accounts and transactions in files or a database for data retention.

**Authentication:** Add login functionality with passwords for account security.

**Interest Calculations:** Calculate and apply interest for savings accounts.

**GUI:** Replace the console menu with a graphical user interface for better usability.
This project serves as a foundation for a more complex online banking application and is excellent for understanding object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and collections in Java.
